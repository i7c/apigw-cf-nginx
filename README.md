Simple static reverse proxy for Cloud Foundry
=============================================
This repo contains all files necessary to create a really simple, static and
stateless API-Gatway on top of Cloud Foundry. We use nginxâ€™s ability to act as
reverse proxy.

The routes are defined in the server section and can point to other CF routes or
external routes alike:

```
  server {
    listen {{port}}; # This will be replaced by CF magic. Just leave it here.

    index index.html index.htm Default.htm;

    location /s1/ {
      proxy_pass http://s1.local.pcfdev.io/;
    }

    location /s2/ {
      proxy_pass http://s2.local.pcfdev.io/;
    }
  }
```

This is a minimal configuration. Other nginx options apply as usual.

Deployment
==========

Cloud Foundry offers an nginx buildpack: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nginx-buildpack.git
The attached config file is derived from their example in fixtures/mainline.

The buildpack includes the server itself, so all you have to do is cd into the
directory where the config files are located (this repo) and run

`cf push api-gateway -b https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nginx-buildpack.git`

Of course you can give it any other name as well. Afterwards check `cf apps`,
copy the route and direct your browser (or HTTP client) to it. Your simplistic
API gateway is up and running. Since it is completely stateless, you can scale
it with `cf scale` to meet your requirements.
